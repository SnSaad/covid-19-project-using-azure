   - Create an Azure Data Factory instance if you don't have one. Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and manage data-driven workflows.
   - Configure the linked services in Azure Data Factory to connect to your ECDC data source. You'll typically use an HTTP linked service to access data from a URL.

4. **Create a Pipeline**:

   - In your Azure Data Factory, create a new pipeline to define the data ingestion process.
   - Add an activity to the pipeline, such as a Copy Data activity, to fetch data from the ECDC website. Configure this activity with the HTTP linked service created in the previous step.

5. **Configure the Data Source**:

   - Specify the URL of the data source on the ECDC website in the source dataset settings.
   - Define the data format and any required authentication details if necessary.

6. **Set the Data Sink**:

   - Create a dataset for your ADLS Gen2 account as the destination for the data.
   - Define the folder or container path where the data should be stored in your ADLS Gen2 account.

7. **Mapping and Transformation**:

   - If needed, you can add data mapping or transformation steps in the pipeline to format the data according to your requirements.

8. **Schedule and Monitor**:

   - Schedule the pipeline to run at regular intervals, ensuring that your ADLS Gen2 data is up to date.
   - Monitor the pipeline runs for any errors or issues.

9. **Data Validation**:

   After the data ingestion, perform data validation to ensure that the data in ADLS Gen2 matches the source data from ECDC accurately.

By following these steps, you can set up a data ingestion process that fetches data from the ECDC website and stores it in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account, making it readily available for analysis and reporting within your Azure environment.
## Data Transformation

Azure Data Flow is used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. We provide examples of data transformation tasks and best practices.

Data transformation in Azure for COVID-19 data involves cleaning, structuring, and preparing the data for analysis. Here are the steps for data transformation using Azure services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Flow, and Azure Data Bricks:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - In Azure Data Factory, create a new pipeline for data transformation.

   - Connect the source dataset to the raw data in ADLS Gen2.

2. **Data Cleansing**:
   - Use Azure Data Flow to clean the data. You can filter out irrelevant columns, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data types.
   - Implement quality checks to ensure data integrity and consistency.

3. **Data Enrichment**:
   - If needed, you can join the COVID-19 data with other datasets to add more context or information. For instance, you might want to join the COVID-19 data with population data, geographical information, or healthcare resource data.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Use Data Flow to perform transformations like aggregations, pivot/unpivot, and data format conversions.
   - Apply business rules and calculations specific to your analysis goals.

5. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Consider partitioning your data in ADLS Gen2 for better query performance. You can partition data by date, location, or other relevant criteria.
   - This is especially useful if you have large datasets, as it can significantly improve query speed.

6. **Data Validation**:
   - Implement data validation checks to ensure that the transformed data adheres to quality standards and business rules.
   - Identify and handle any anomalies or errors in the data.

7. **Data Loading**:
   - Create a destination dataset in Azure Data Factory for storing the transformed data.
   - Configure the dataset to write data to a specific folder or container in your ADLS Gen2 account.

8. **Data Publication**:
   - After data transformation, make the transformed data available for analysis by your data scientists or other stakeholders.
   - Ensure that the data is accessible through Azure services like Azure Data Bricks for advanced analytics.

9. **Automation and Scheduling**:
   - Schedule the data transformation pipeline to run at regular intervals to keep the data up to date.
   - Set up alerts or notifications in case of data transformation failures.

By following these data transformation steps in Azure, you can ensure that your COVID-19 data is properly prepared for analysis, making it easier for data scientists and analysts to derive meaningful insights from the data.
