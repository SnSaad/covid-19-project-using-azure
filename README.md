### Step 1: JSON Configuration File
- Create a `config.json` file containing source URLs and sink file names for each dataset.
- Sample JSON structure:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "sourceBaseUrl": "https://example.com/hospital_data",
            "sourceRelativeUrl": "/hospital_data.json",
            "sinkFileName": "hospital_admission_data.json"
        },
        // Other dataset configurations follow the same format...
    ]
    ```
### Step 2: Azure Data Factory Setup
- Use Azure Data Factory to configure a Lookup activity to fetch dataset configurations from the `config.json` file.
- Define parameters to read source URLs and sink file names.

### Step 3: ForEach Activity for Data Copy
- Implement a ForEach activity in Azure Data Factory to iterate through each dataset listed in `config.json`.
- Use parameters retrieved from the Lookup activity to copy data from specified source URLs to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

### Step 4: Data Storage in Data Lake Gen2
- Organize data into a 'raw' folder structure within Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Store datasets in respective 'raw' folders based on sink file names specified in `config.json`.

### Step 5: Pipeline Execution and Validation
- Run the Azure Data Factory pipeline to trigger data ingestion.
- Review execution logs to confirm successful ingestion for each dataset.
- Validate dataset presence in the designated 'raw' folders within Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Data Transformation

Azure Data Flow is used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. We provide examples of data transformation tasks and best practices.

Data transformation in Azure for COVID-19 data involves cleaning, structuring, and preparing the data for analysis. Here are the steps for data transformation using Azure services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Flow, and Azure Data Bricks:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - In Azure Data Factory, create a new pipeline for data transformation.
   - Use a source dataset to read data from your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 where the COVID-19 data was ingested.
   - Connect the source dataset to the raw data in ADLS Gen2.

2. **Data Cleansing**:
   - Use Azure Data Flow to clean the data. You can filter out irrelevant columns, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data types.
   - Implement quality checks to ensure data integrity and consistency.

3. **Data Enrichment**:
   - If needed, you can join the COVID-19 data with other datasets to add more context or information. For instance, you might want to join the COVID-19 data with population data, geographical information, or healthcare resource data.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Use Data Flow to perform transformations like aggregations, pivot/unpivot, and data format conversions.
   - Apply business rules and calculations specific to your analysis goals.

5. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Consider partitioning your data in ADLS Gen2 for better query performance. You can partition data by date, location, or other relevant criteria.
   - This is especially useful if you have large datasets, as it can significantly improve query speed.

6. **Data Validation**:
   - Implement data validation checks to ensure that the transformed data adheres to quality standards and business rules.
   - Identify and handle any anomalies or errors in the data.

7. **Data Loading**:
   - Create a destination dataset in Azure Data Factory for storing the transformed data.
   - Configure the dataset to write data to a specific folder or container in your ADLS Gen2 account.

8. **Data Publication**:
   - After data transformation, make the transformed data available for analysis by your data scientists or other stakeholders.
   - Ensure that the data is accessible through Azure services like Azure Data Bricks for advanced analytics.

9. **Automation and Scheduling**:
   - Schedule the data transformation pipeline to run at regular intervals to keep the data up to date.
   - Set up alerts or notifications in case of data transformation failures.

By following these data transformation steps in Azure, you can ensure that your COVID-19 data is properly prepared for analysis, making it easier for data scientists and analysts to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Data Analysis

Azure Data Bricks is employed for advanced data analysis. We demonstrate how to load data, perform analytics, and visualize the results using various Spark libraries and tools.

Analyzing COVID-19 data using Azure Databricks involves a series of steps, including data loading, exploration, transformation, and visualization. Here are the key analysis steps you can follow:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the cleaned and transformed COVID-19 data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) or your preferred data source into your Databricks workspace. You can use Databricks' built-in data connectors or libraries to read the data.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Start by examining the structure of your dataset. You can use Databricks to display the first few rows of your data to understand its format and column names.
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the data.
   - Perform basic summary statistics to get an initial understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Depending on your specific analysis goals, you may need to further preprocess the data. This can include data aggregation, grouping, filtering, or creating new derived features.
   - Handle data types and formatting to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Utilize Databricks' data visualization capabilities to create meaningful plots, charts, and graphs. You can use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly in Python to generate visualizations.
   - Visualize key COVID-19 statistics over time, by region, or according to other relevant dimensions.

5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conduct statistical analyses to identify trends and correlations in the COVID-19 data. You can use Databricks' built-in statistical functions and libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
   - Perform time series analysis to understand the progression of the pandemic.

By following these steps, you can conduct a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data in Azure Databricks, enabling you to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions related to the pandemic.
