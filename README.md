# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Microsoft Azure

## Overview

This project leverages Microsoft Azure services, including Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2), Azure Data Bricks (ADB), and Azure Data Flow, to analyze COVID-19 data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Azure's powerful data analytics and processing capabilities can be harnessed to gain insights from a global health crisis.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need the following:

- An Azure subscription
- Basic knowledge of Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Data Bricks, and Azure Data Flow

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- **Setup**: Instructions for setting up your Azure environment and resources.
- **Data Ingestion**: Details on how to ingest COVID-19 data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using Azure Data Factory.
- **Data Transformation**: How to use Azure Data Flow for data cleansing, transformation, and preparation.
- **Data Analysis**: Examples of data analysis using Azure Data Bricks.
- **Results**: The insights and findings obtained from the analysis.

## Setup

1. Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
2. Set up an Azure Data Factory instance.
3. Configure an Azure Data Bricks workspace.
4. Prepare your development environment, including installing required libraries.

## Data Ingestion

In this section, we provide steps and scripts to ingest COVID-19 data into your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account using Azure Data Factory. You can schedule data ingestion jobs to keep your data up to date.

## Data Transformation

Azure Data Flow is used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. We provide examples of data transformation tasks and best practices.

## Data Analysis

Azure Data Bricks is employed for advanced data analysis. We demonstrate how to load data, perform analytics, and visualize the results using various Spark libraries and tools.

## Results

The results section presents the insights obtained from the analysis, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and any significant findings related to COVID-19 data.

## Contributing
